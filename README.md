# ğŸ‘» Gulp + Sass template

- ğŸ‘‰ Hey stranger, what you see is my starter template for scaffolding all my Gulp-Sass Based Projects 
- A big ğŸ™Œ ğŸ¥‚ to @thecodercoder ( find her account here ğŸ‘‰ `https://github.com/thecodercoder` ) for her tutorial on how to set up a frontend workflow using gulp and Sass.

## âœ… How to use :
- You want to use this.. i'm okay with that, at least someone wants to use some 'software' i 'stole' ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜…. Enough of that, let's get started.
- You want to make sure you have gulp installed globally. To do this go into the terminal and type in -> `npm install -g gulp`.
- Next clone this repository in your preffered method ( using `git clone <url>` or github Desktop, you decide ğŸ˜‹) .
- Finally, you want to make sure yo have a terminal opened in the cloned directory and type in `gulp`. Viola ğŸ˜….. 

#### Happy debugging ğŸ˜‰
