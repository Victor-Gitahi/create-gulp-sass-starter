# ðŸ‘» Gulp + Sass template

- ðŸ‘‰ Hey stranger, what you see is my starter template for scaffolding all my Gulp-Sass Based Projects 
- A big ðŸ™Œ ðŸ¥‚ to @thecodercoder ( find her account here ðŸ‘‰ `https://github.com/thecodercoder` ) for her tutorial on how to set up a frontend workflow using gulp and Sass.

## âœ… How to use :
- You want to use this.. i'm okay with that, at least someone wants to use some 'software' i 'stole' ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. Enough of that, let's get started.
- You want to make sure you have gulp installed globally. To do this go into the terminal and type in -> `npm install -g gulp`.
- Next up, click tha `Use this template` button to create a repository using this template.
- Clone the repository into your local machine and in the repository folder, type in `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Finally, you want to make sure yo have a terminal opened in the cloned directory and type in `gulp`. Viola ðŸ˜….. 

##### Happy coding or should i say..debugging ðŸ˜‰
